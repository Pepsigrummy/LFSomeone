# LFSomeone (name still in discussion)

## General

The purpose of the website is to provide support for gamers around the globe to find a group with like-minded people to play along with. Therefore the user is able to create a group to look for other players (LFM) or join directly in a already created group (LFG).

## Motivation

There are a lot of games out there where it is hard to find a proper group to have some good time, or in the worst case there isn't even a possibilty of creating a group and you get a randomized group with gamers of different skill levels. That's what this website is all about, providing a platform to exchange information to be able to create groups on your own.
